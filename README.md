Date From-To
============

Date from-to is supposed to be a simple class that allows you display a date in a From/To format. 

What this means is by providing a start/end date, you can have an output such as:

*March 23-26, 2011*

Take note of the 23-26 date which is what we are looking for. So dates don't end up like:

*March 23, 2011 - March 26, 2011*

## Future Ideas

Create a gem for this in ruby if one is not made already.
